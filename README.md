The site is hosted at https://asteffey.github.io/fcc-drum-machine/.  
Alternatively, it can be viewed with the [freeCodeCamp test suite](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js) 
by appending [`?fcc-test`](https://asteffey.github.io/fcc-drum-machine/?fcc-test) to the URL.

This is a [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) project which uses React to create a simple calculator. 
Additionally, this project also demonstrates the use of Rebass, ESLint, and a basic CI/CD pipeline using Travis with deployment to GitHub pages.

The project requirements can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine.
